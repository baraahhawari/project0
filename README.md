**installing sass**

1. `sudo apt install ruby-sass`.
1. If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running:
   `npm install -g sass`

**run the sass**:

1. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to
   `sass css/input.scss css/output.css`
1. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass
   `sass --watch css/input.scss:css/output.css`
